# Halfminer System
Base Spigot plugin API for Minecraft Server [Two and a half Miner](https://halfminer.de).

Contains handlers, caches and utilities that are shared between all Halfminer Bukkit/Spigot plugins in this repository.

## Current features
- Central ``HalfminerManager`` serves as hub for persistence across plugins
  - Manages configuration file updates
  - (Un-)registers classes from Bukkit event manager implementing ``Listener`` interface
  - Registered classes may implement additional interfaces â€¦
    - ``Disableable`` - to be called when the parent plugin shuts down
    - ``Reloadable`` - to be called when the plugins config was reloaded
    - ``Sweepable`` - to be called in a set interval for cleanup
- **Caches**
  - ``ActionProbabilityContainer``
    - Class reading a list containing key:value pairings, where key is the probability as a number relative to other list elements and value is the action name
      - Example: List containing ``2:action1`` and ``1:action2`` has 66,6% chance to run action1, 33,3% to run action2
    - Returns a random CustomAction on demand
  - ``CustomAction``
    - Reads customactions.txt in plugin directory and executes defined actions
      - Uses ``CustomtextCache`` syntax, where chapter is action name and content is a list of actions
    - Supports placeholders for every action
      - Custom placeholders can be passed before execution of action
      - ``%PLAYER%`` and ``%PLAYER1-N%`` always active
    - Currently supported actions
      - ``players |number|``: define a minimum amount of players that must be passed to this action to execute
      - ``hasroom |number| [stacksize]``: execution flow will only continue if given amount of slots are free, optional stacksize parameter that will divide the given number
      - ``cmd |command|``: execute command as console
      - ``give |customitem|``: hands out customitem defined in customitems.txt
      - ``broadcast |message|``: broadcast a given message
      - ``tell |message|``: send a given message to main player
    - Stops execution flow if previous action fails 
      - Example: If ``broadcast`` action is below ``give`` action and item could not be given, there will be no broadcast
  - ``CustomitemCache``
    - Uses ``CustomtextCache`` syntax
    - Chaptername is itemname
    - First line in chapter must be Minecraft Material name
    - Supports ``%PLAYER%`` placeholder (player name that receives item) and custom ones can be passed aswell

    - Will throw ``ItemCacheException`` if item wasn't given to player
  - ``CustomtextCache``
    - Flatfile based text cache, segmented in chapters
    - To mark a chapter, use ``#chaptername argument`` (argument optional and not limited to one, case insensitive)
